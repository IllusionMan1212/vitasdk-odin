# vitasdk-odin

[vitasdk](https://github.com/vitasdk/vita-headers) bindings for [Odin](https://orin-lang.org)

### TODO:
- [ ] Jpeg library (not sure how to bind this, might completely skip it)
- [ ] No bindings for the `psp2kern` libraries
- [ ] Clean up TODOs and make sure the types used are mostly correct

#### NOTE: The vita-headers submodule is only there to show which version the bindings currently adhere to.
